## What is spark?
spark is an open source coding language designed to make coding an easier job. For example, instead of
### This    
 ~~~
public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          spark("hi");
      }
  
      public static void spark(String arg) {
          System.out.println(arg);
      }
  }
~~~
we have
### This
~~~
spark("hi")
~~~
spark isn't just making code easy. spark provides a simple way to do a (what should be) simple task.
